# Sound System Implementation Summary

## Overview
A complete sound system has been added to the Quantum Nexus game, allowing users to enable/disable sounds via their profile settings.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Model (`models.py`)
- ‚úÖ Added `sound_enabled` field to `User` model (Boolean, default=True)
- Users can now toggle sounds on/off in their profile

### 2. Keyboards (`keyboards.py`)
- ‚úÖ Added "‚öôÔ∏è –ü—Ä–æ—Ñ–∏–ª—å" button to main menu
- ‚úÖ Added `get_profile_menu()` function with:
  - Sound toggle switch
  - Three test sound buttons (Stage 1, 2, 3)
  - Back button

### 3. Handlers (`handlers.py`)
- ‚úÖ Added `start_command()` - creates new users with sounds enabled by default
- ‚úÖ Added `button_callback()` - handles all button interactions including profile/sound controls
- ‚úÖ Added `show_profile()` - displays profile/settings menu
- ‚úÖ Added `toggle_sound()` - toggles sound on/off
- ‚úÖ Added `test_sound()` - plays test sounds (for first stage)
- ‚úÖ Integrated sound playing in `handle_tap()` - plays tap sound

### 4. Sound Utilities (`utils.py`)
- ‚úÖ Added `should_play_sound()` - checks if user has sounds enabled
- ‚úÖ Added `get_sound_file()` - returns sound file path for sound type
- ‚úÖ Added `play_sound()` - plays sound if enabled (logs event for web app integration)

### 5. Sound Files Directory
- ‚úÖ Created `sounds/` directory structure
- ‚úÖ Added `sounds/README.md` with documentation

## Sound Types Implemented

1. **tap** - Sound for tap actions (Stage 1 test sound)
2. **mining** - Sound for mining actions (Stage 2 test sound)
3. **purchase** - Sound for purchase actions (Stage 3 test sound)
4. **level_up** - Sound for level up events (future)
5. **achievement** - Sound for achievement unlocks (future)

## Database Migration

Run the SQL migration file to add the column to existing databases:
```sql
-- See ADD_SOUND_SYSTEM.sql
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS sound_enabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE;
```

## User Flow

1. User opens bot and sees main menu
2. User clicks "‚öôÔ∏è –ü—Ä–æ—Ñ–∏–ª—å" button
3. Profile menu shows:
   - User stats (coins, quanhash, energy)
   - Current sound status (–í–∫–ª—é—á–µ–Ω—ã/–í—ã–∫–ª—é—á–µ–Ω—ã)
   - Toggle sound button
   - Three test sound buttons
4. User can toggle sounds on/off
5. User can test sounds (Stage 1, 2, 3)
6. Sounds play during game actions if enabled

## Integration with Web App

The sound system is designed to work with a Telegram Mini App:
- Bot logs sound events
- Web app receives sound preferences from user object
- Web app plays sounds using HTML5 Audio API
- Sound files should be placed in `sounds/` directory on web server

## Testing

To test the sound system:
1. Start the bot
2. Click "‚öôÔ∏è –ü—Ä–æ—Ñ–∏–ª—å" in main menu
3. Use "üîä –¢–µ—Å—Ç –∑–≤—É–∫–∞ 1/2/3" buttons to test sounds
4. Toggle sounds on/off and verify behavior

## Future Enhancements

- Add more sound types (level up, achievements, etc.)
- Volume control
- Different sound packs/themes
- Sound preview before enabling
- Web app HTML5 audio integration
